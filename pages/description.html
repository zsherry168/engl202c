      <h1>An Overview of the Linked List</h1>
      <p>
        In computer science, a data structure is a specialized format used to organize, process, store, and retrieve data. Some examples of common data structures 
        include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Each data structure has its advantages and disadvantages, whether it is relative to access time or memory 
        usage. This overview will specifically cover what a linked list is and how it works.
      </p>
      <h2>Linked List</h2>
      <p>
        A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes. Also known as building blocks, a node stores a piece of data and a pointer to the next 
        node in the list. The data can be anything. It can be an integer, a string, or even another linked list. On the other hand, pointers are variables that store 
        a memory address. In this scenario, the NEXT pointer of a node holds the address of where the next node in the list sits in memory. If the node is the last 
        one in the list, it will point to NULL, meaning no value exists.
      </p>
      <center>

        <p><i>Figure 1: Diagram of a basic linked list</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>
        Together, these nodes—when linked together via NEXT pointers—form the linked list. An example is provided in Figure 1.<sup>1</sup> There are three nodes in the linked list, 
        each indicated by the elliptical dashed line. Within each node, there is the data and the NEXT pointer. As seen above, NEXT has an arrow that points to the next 
        node, indicating a link between the two nodes. In the case of the last node, the NEXT pointer referencing NULL denotes the end of the linked list.
      </p>
      <h2>The “Head” of the List</h2>
      <p>
        In Figure 1, there is also a pointer called HEAD, which points to the first node or start of the linked list. If HEAD points to NULL, it means the linked list 
        is empty. The HEAD pointer is crucial because it serves as the entry point to the linked list. Without the HEAD pointer, there would be no way to access the 
        nodes inside the linked list, as each node is sequentially linked and can be accessed from the previous one. Furthermore, the HEAD pointer allows operations, 
        such as insertion, deletion, and traversal by providing a start point. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a linked list may also have a TAIL, which marks the last node or the end of the linked list. Both the HEAD and TAIL need to be updated by the programmer 
        when he or she inserts or deletes nodes from the front or end of the linked list. 
      </p>
      <h2>Insertion</h2>
      <p>
        The insertion operation of a linked list allows the addition of new nodes to the list with minimal overhead. There are three ways to insert a new node: in the 
        beginning, in the middle, and at the end. To keep it simple, only insertion in the beginning will be covered as it is the most commonly used insertion policy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To insert a new node at the beginning of the list, the NEXT pointer of the new node is set to the current HEAD of the list. After, the HEAD pointer is updated to 
        point to the new node. In Figure 2 below, a new node E is inserted to the front of the linked list. (1) The NEXT pointer of E points to the HEAD of the list, node 
        A. (2) After, the HEAD pointer is reassigned to the new node E, denoting a successful insertion.
      </p>

      </center>
      <h2>Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        Deletion of nodes from a linked list involves removing a node from the list by re-linking the neighboring nodes to maintain the integrity of the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        To delete a node, the node to be deleted must be located by traversing the list from the head until found or the address of the node must be provided. If the node 
        to be deleted is at the beginning, the head pointer is simply updated to the next node. However, for a node in the middle or at the end, the previous node’s NEXT 
        pointer is reassigned to skip the node to be deleted and point directly to the node following it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In Figure 3 below, the node C is to be removed from the linked list. Node C’s previous node is B; the next node is D. (1) As shown, node B’s NEXT pointer now points 
        to node D, completely removing C from the linked list.

      <h2>Different Types of Linked List</h2>
      <p>
        The linked list covered so far is the singly linked list. Now it is time to explore their variants: doubly linked list, circular linked list, and circular doubly linked list.
      </p>
      <h3><i>Doubly Linked List</i></h3>
      <p>
        The doubly linked list builds off of the singly linked list by allowing two-way traversal. In this linked list, each node contains two pointers: the PREV pointer and the 
        NEXT pointer. The PREV pointer points to the node that precedes the current node in the list. Figure 4 is a representation of the doubly linked list.
      </p>

        <p><i>Figure 4: Doubly linked list</i></p>
      </center>
      <h3><i>Circular Linked List</i></h3>
      <p>
        The circular linked list modifies the singly linked list by making the last node point back to the first node, creating a circular structure. This means that no nodes will 
        point to NULL. A visual of a circular linked list is provided in Figure 5.
      </p>
      <center>
        <img src="./images/circular_linked_list.png" width="85%" height=auto>
        <p><i>Figure 5: Circular linked list</i></p>
      </center>
      <h3><i>Circular Doubly Linked List</i></h3>
      <p>
        The circular doubly linked list combines the doubly linked list and circular linked list. It is doubly linked, with the first node pointing back to the last node and the 
        last node pointing back to the first node to form a circle. Figure 6 provides an example of the circular doubly linked list.

      <h2>Purpose of Linked Lists</h2>
      <p>
        Linked lists are fundamental in computer science to organize and manage data. They are used in dynamic memory allocation to keep track of the free memory spaces in the heap. 
        Furthermore, linked lists are used in everyday real-life applications. For example, linked lists are utilized to implement the browser history feature. Each page visited can 
        be represented by a node in a doubly linked list, allowing forward and backward navigation of the history. This is just one example exemplifying the flexibility and efficiency 
        of linked lists for managing data in everyday applications.
