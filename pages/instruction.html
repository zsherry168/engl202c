      <h1>How to Use the Terminal to Run a Python File (MacOS)</h1>
      <p>
        This instruction manual teaches users how to run their Python files in the MacOS terminal by covering basic terminal commands, directory navigation, 
        and Python commands for executing programs. Knowing how to run a Python file in the terminal is important because it provides users with direct control 
        over the script’s execution and helps with debugging.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: These instructions are for computer science beginners with a MacOS device, which uses the Unix-based operating system. Furthermore, it is expected 
        that the user already has Visual Studio Code and Python installed and updated to the latest version. 
      </p>
      <h2>Materials</h2>
      <li>MacOS device (Mac or Macbook)</li>
      <li>Terminal</li>
      <li>Python file (with code written inside)<br><br></li>
      <h2>Terminal Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Every computer has a file system, which governs, manages, and organizes the computer’s files and directories (also known as folders). The file system can 
        be represented as a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 1.<sup>1</sup> It starts at the root, which is the top directory of the hierarchical file tree. Users can move up and 
        down the hierarchical tree to find desired files or directories. Each file and directory will also have its path, which is the specific location or route 
        used to uniquely identify where the file or directory is in the file system.

      <p>
        On MacOS, files and directories can be accessed through Finder or a variety of Unix commands via Terminal. To be brief, Finder uses a graphical user interface 
        (GUI) that represents the file system with icons, windows, and menus, making it easy for those with no computer background to use. Meanwhile, Terminal uses a 
        command line interface (CLI), which is a text-based interface used for interacting with the computer, running programs, and managing files. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For this instruction set, Terminal will be used to run a Python program. Users need to familiarize themselves with the following three Unix commands before proceeding. 
      </p>
      <li>
        pwd - Short for print working directory,  pwd  prints the full name (path) of the current directory that is used at the moment. To note, the current directory, 
        which is also the last directory in the path, is listed before the % symbol. <br></br>
        <p>
          As shown below, after entering pwd, the terminal prints the path /Users/sherryzhang, where sherryzhang is the current directory. sherryzhang is equivalent to ~, 
          which represents the home directory of the user, hence why ~ is displayed instead of sherryzhang. Your ~ will have a different name.
        </p>
