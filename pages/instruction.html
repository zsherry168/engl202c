      <h1>How to Use the Terminal to Run a Python File (MacOS)</h1>
      <p>
        This instruction manual teaches users how to run their Python files in the MacOS terminal by covering basic terminal commands, directory navigation, 
        and Python commands for executing programs. Knowing how to run a Python file in the terminal is important because it provides users with direct control 
        over the script’s execution and helps with debugging.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: These instructions are for computer science beginners with a MacOS device, which uses the Unix-based operating system. Furthermore, it is expected 
        that the user already has Visual Studio Code and Python installed and updated to the latest version.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Materials</h2>
      <li>MacOS device (Mac or Macbook)</li>
      <li>Terminal</li>
      <li>Python file (with code written inside)</li><br>
      <h2>Terminal Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Every computer has a file system, which governs, manages, and organizes the computer’s files and directories (also known as folders). The file system can 
        be represented as a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 1.<sup>1</sup> It starts at the root, which is the top directory of the hierarchical file tree. Users 
        can move up and down the hierarchical tree to find desired files or directories. Each file and directory will also have its path, which is the specific 
        location or route used to uniquely identify where the file or directory is in the file system.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>
        On MacOS, files and directories can be accessed through Finder or a variety of Unix commands via Terminal. To be brief, Finder uses a graphical user interface 
        (GUI) that represents the file system with icons, windows, and menus, making it easy for those with no computer background to use. Meanwhile, Terminal uses a 
        command line interface (CLI), which is a text-based interface used for interacting with the computer, running programs, and managing files. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For this instruction set, Terminal will be used to run a Python program. Users need to familiarize themselves with the following three Unix commands before proceeding. 
      </p>
      <li>
          <b>pwd</b> - Short for print working directory, <code class="terminal">pwd</code> prints the full name (path) of the current directory that is used at the 
          moment. To note, the current directory, which is also the last directory in the path, is listed before the <code>%</code> symbol. <br></br>

          <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            As shown below, after entering <code>pwd</code>, the terminal prints the path <code>/Users/sherryzhang</code>, where <code>sherryzhang</code> is the current directory. 
            <code>sherryzhang</code> is equivalent to <code>~</code>, which represents the home directory of the user, hence why <code>~</code> is displayed instead of 
            <code>sherryzhang</code>. <span style="color: red">Your <code style="color: red">~</code> will have a different name—your username.</span><br>
            <img src="images/pwd.png" width="40%" height=auto><br><br>
          </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>ls</b> - Short for list, <code class="terminal">ls</code> displays all files and directories under the user’s current directory. To show hidden files too, type 
        <code class="terminal">ls -a</code> instead.<br><br>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
          Upon typing <code>ls</code>, the terminal displays all the files and folders (Applications, Downloads, Documents, etc.) under the current directory <code>~</code> 
          (also known as <code>sherryzhang</code>).<br>
          <img src="images/ls.png" width="85%" height=auto><br><br>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>cd</b> - Short for change directory, <code>cd</code> is used to move to another directory. To use the command, the user should first type <code>cd</code>, followed by 
        the name of the directory they want to navigate to.<br><br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
          &#x2022; To move down to a new directory: <code class="terminal">cd name_of_directory</code>, where <code>name_of_directory</code> is the next directory<br>
          &#x2022; To return to the previous directory: <code class="terminal">cd ..</code><br><br>
          NOTE: If you get the error <span style="color:red">cd: no such file or directory</span>, it means the directory you are trying to navigate to does not exist under 
          your current directory.<br><br>
          The current directory is <code>sherryzhang</code>. The desired directory is <code>Documents</code>. After entering <code>cd Documents</code>, the new path is 
          <code>Users/sherryzhang/Documents</code>, meaning the current directory is now <code>Documents</code>. A change in path indicates a successful directory change.<br>
          <img src="images/cd_forward.png" width="53%" height=auto><br><br>
          <code>cd ..</code> is being used to return to the <code>sherryzhang</code> directory from <code>Documents</code>.<br>
          <img src="images/cd_back.png" width="48%" height=auto><br><br>
        </div>
      </li>
      <p>
        With the three commands discussed above, one will be able to easily navigate the terminal to find desired files and directories.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2>Navigating to the Correct Directory</h2>
      <p>
        Before running the Python file, it is necessary to ensure that you are in the correct directory. Using the three commands covered above (pwd, ls, and cd), you will need 
        to navigate to the directory where the Python file is located. 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Determine the path by figuring out which folder the Python file is in.</b>
            Which directory did you create and store your Python file in? If you are using Visual Studio Code, the path should be displayed at the top of the text editor. You can 
            also go to Finder and check which folder the file is under. In this case, my path is <code>Users/sherryzhang/Documents/courses/hello.py</code>, and <code>hello.py</code> 
            is under the directory courses, which is my target directory.<br>
          <img src="./images/path.png" width="45%" height=auto><br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Open your Terminal.</b>
          If you cannot find Terminal, search for it under Spotlight Search (click the magnifying glass icon on the top right of your screen). Upon opening Terminal, a black box 
          should appear with an area to write text.<br>
          <img src="./images/terminal.png" width="55%" height=auto><br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Type pwd to locate the current directory.</b>
          This will help you understand where your starting point is. In my case, I am starting in the <code>sherryzhang</code> directory.<br>
          <img src="images/pwd.png" width="40%" height=auto><br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Type ls to see which files and directories are under the current directory.</b>
          By listing all the directories and files under the current directory, you can see if you are on the right path. The <code>sherryzhang</code> directory has 13 folders and 2 
          files. The next directory in the path I am looking for is <code>Documents</code>, which is indeed under <code>sherryzhang</code>.<br>
          <img src="images/ls.png" width="85%" height=auto><br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use the cd command to navigate to the next directory in the path.</b>
          The next directory follows right after the current directory in the path. Type <code>cd</code> with the name of the folder followed after to change directories. In the 
          example below, I changed my directory to <code>Documents</code> since it is the directory that follows after <code>sherryzhang</code> in the path. If you navigated to the 
          wrong directory, type <code>cd ..</code> to return to the previous directory.<br>
          <img src="./images/cd_nav.png" width="48%" height=auto><br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Repeat Step 5 until you reach the directory containing the Python file.</b>
          For additional help, use Step 3 to check if you are on the correct path, and use Step 4 to see if the next directory exists. In the example below, I use <code>pwd</code> to 
          see where I am on the path. Then, I use <code>cd</code> to change to the next directory in the path. I repeat those steps until I am in the directory where my Python file is 
          located. In this case, my Python file <code>hello.py</code> (highlighted in blue) is located under the <code>courses</code> directory, which I successfully located.<br>
          <img src="./images/navigate.png" width="70%" height=auto><br><br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Running the Python File</h2>
      <p>
        Now that the terminal is in the correct directory, the Python file can be run. The command for running the Python file is <code class="terminal"">python3 name_of_file.py</code>, 
        where <code>name_of_file</code> is the name of the Python file. The <code>.py</code> indicates that the file is a Python file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, the file I want to run is <code>hello.py</code>, where hello is the name of the file. Upon entering the command, the terminal runs the Python script and outputs the result. 
        In <code>hello.py</code>, the Python program prints “Hello World!” and lets the user know that the program has successfully run.<br>
        <img src="./images/run_python_file.png" width="60%"><br><br>
      </p>
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <p>
        If you run the Python file and see the error message <span style="color:red">[Errno 2] No such file or directory</span>, it means that you are in the wrong directory. In other 
        words, the Python file cannot be found under the current directory that you are in. To fix the issue, refer back to the section “Navigating to the Correct Directory” to find the 
        right directory.<br>
