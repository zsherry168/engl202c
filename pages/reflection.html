        <p style="font-size: 60px;">Reflection</p>
        <p>
          The objective of the reflection is to discuss the technical written work I have completed.
        </p>
      </center>
      <a href="./description.html" style="text-decoration: None;"><h1>Description</h1></a>
      <p>
        A technical description explains the features, operations, and aspects of a product, system, or process—often including diagrams or 
        specifications to aid understanding. For my description, I chose to write about the linked list, a data structure in computer science 
        used to store data linearly. The reason why I chose a linked list is that I wanted to display my knowledge of data structures since I 
        am a teaching assistant for data structures at Penn State. From writing a description, I learned how to write in detail since the 
        description has to be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Furthermore, I hope from this assignment that others can see my passion 
        for teaching data structures. 
      </p>
      <a href="./documentation.html" style="text-decoration: None;"><h1>Documentation</h1></a>
      <p>
        Documentation is a collection of documents that provide detailed information or instructions about a product, system, or procedure—serving 
        as a reference for users and developers. The documentation I wrote was for my systems programming class. We created a mdadm library 
        used for creating, managing, and monitoring RAID devices. In the documentation, I discuss every function I wrote, including its parameters, 
        return values, and examples of utilizing the function in a program. Upon completing the documentation, I learned how to write documents 
        for software programs, which is very important as it serves as a manual for users and other programmers. Ultimately, the documentation 
        is a good indicator of my ability to explain code in a user-friendly way. 
      </p>
      <a href="./instruction.html" style="text-decoration: None;"><h1>Instruction Set</h1></a>
      <p>
        An instruction set provides detailed information on how something is supposed to work, operate, or assemble. The instruction set I wrote 
        discusses running a Python file using the MacOS terminal. I wrote instructions for the terminal because I use it often for programming and 
        development and have taught it to my students. Hence, the instruction set demonstrates my knowledge of software and my ability to explain 
        it to others. From this assignment, I also learned how to write descriptively and how to format instructions so they are readable. I believe 
        being able to write clear instructions is important because it ensures clear communication and increases efficiency in performing tasks. 
      </p>
      <a href="./report.html" style="text-decoration: None;"><h1>Report</h1></a>
      <p>
        A report provides a detailed account of a project's objectives, methodologies, progress, results, and conclusions. In this case, my 
        report is from my Harris Corner Detection algorithm project. As the name sounds, the algorithm identifies regions in an image with 
        large variations in intensity in all directions, effectively detecting corners and intersections. Given the great details in the report, 
        I want others to see my understanding of computer vision concepts and my ability to write technical documents for niche subjects. From 
        writing this assignment, I learned how to format a report, which is very similar to how research papers are formatted. Overall, I 
        want to showcase this report to demonstrate my skills in writing about large projects.
      </p>
      <a href="./resume.html" style="text-decoration: None;"><h1>Resume</h1></a>
      <p>
        A resume is a document for job applications that summarizes a candidate's professional qualifications, including their education, 
        experience, skills, and achievements. Through my resume, I want to show employers my technical abilities in programming and my 
        knowledge of data structures and web development. In fact, in my resume, I highlight my role as a teaching assistant in data structures 
        as well as my web development projects from the past year. From this assignment, I learned how to format a resume to target 
        different roles and how to summarize important information about myself. Based on my resume, I hope future employers consider 
        me for software engineering and other technology-related positions.
