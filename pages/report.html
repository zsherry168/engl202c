      <h1>Harris Corner Detection Project Report</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The objective of the project is to implement the Harris Corner Detection algorithm to successfully identify corners in images. 
        In our project, we used Gaussian smoothing and derivations to compute a response (R) score for each pixel in the image around 
        its local neighborhood. Using the response score, we apply non-max suppression to extract the best number of corners (given as 
        a parameter). Identifying corners is vital for patch matching as corners provide the most reliable information about a structure 
        or object we aim to identify.
      </p>
      <h2>Algorithmic Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We approached the Harris Corner Detection algorithm by following the tasks listed in the instructions.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Read in a file of input parameters that governs the behavior of the program</b><br>
          <code>
            % read in file of input params<br>
            [img, s, n, d, m] = read_corner_parameters('cornerparams.dat');<br><br>
          </code>
          <p>
            The code above was provided  in the instructions, and it reads in the input parameters. Below is a breakdown of each input:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <code>img</code> - image filename
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <code>sigma</code> - Gaussian smoothing kernel sigma (standard deviation)
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <code>n</code> - size of the local NxN neighborhood for accumulating sums for Harris corner detection
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <code>d</code> - radius of neighborhood for suppressing multiple corner responses
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <code>cornerNum</code> - number of corners we want to detect
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 15px;">
          <b>Read in the image and convert it to a grayscale, double float image</b>
          <code>
            <br>% read in image, convert to double float grayscale<br>
            im = imread(img); im = double(im);<br>
            greyIm = (im(:,:,1)+im(:,:,2)+im(:,:,3))/3;<br><br>
          </code>
          <p>
            Converting an image to grayscale simplifies image processing by reducing complexity and computation requirements needed to process 
            color information. By grayscaling, the algorithm focuses solely on the intensity and texture of the image. Next, we convert the 
            image to double float as it increases the precision of calculations, giving more accurate and detailed results of pixel values. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Smooth the image using a Gaussian filter</b>
          <code>
            <br>% gaussian filter calculations<br>
            halfwid = 3 * s;<br>
            [xx,yy] = meshgrid(-halfwid:halfwid, -halfwid:halfwid);<br>
            gauFilt = (exp(-1/(2*s ^ 2) * (xx .^2 + yy.^2)));<br>
            norm = 1 / sum(gauFilt, "all");<br><br>
            
            % smooth the image using gaussian filter<br>
            smoothedIm = imfilter(greyIm, gauFilt * norm, 'same', 'replicate');<br><br>
          </code>
          <p>
            First, we determined the size of the Gaussian filter by calculating the half-width of the filter. The variable `s` represents the 
            standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. By multiplying `s` by 3, we ensure that the size of the Gaussian filter is large 
            enough to cover over 99% of the total area under the Gaussian curve. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we created a grid in the line `[xx,yy] = meshgrid(-halfwid:halfwid, -halfwid:halfwid);`. This line generates two matrices `xx` 
            and `yy` using the meshgrid function, respectively. The matrices represent the x and y coordinates of a grid spanning from `-halfwid`
            to `+halfwid`. The grid is used to compute the value of the Gaussian function at every pixel within the filter’s size.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then calculated the Gaussian filter with `gauFilt = (exp(-1/(2*s ^ 2) * (xx .^2 + yy.^2)));` for every point. This results in a matrix 
            `gauFilt` where each element represents the filter’s weight at the corresponding point. The filter values are highest at the center (0, 0) 
            and decrease as it travels away from the center. After, we normalize the filter, ensuring that all elements sum up to 1, by taking the 
            inverse of the sum of all elements in the `gauFilt`  matrix.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last, we applied the Gaussian smoothing filter to the grayscale image to reduce noise before finding the gradients of Gx and Gy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Compute the gradients images of Gx and Gy</b>
          <code>
            <br>% compute gradient images using central difference<br>
            centralDiff = [0.5 0 -0.5];<br>
            Gx = imfilter(smoothedIm, centralDiff, 'same', 'replicate');<br>
            Gy = imfilter(smoothedIm, centralDiff', 'same', 'replicate');<br>
          </code>
          <p>
            <br>After smoothing the image, we computed the gradients  Gx and Gy , which represents the first derivative of the image intensity relative 
            to the horizontal and vertical directions. Significant changes in intensity are indicated by the high values of these gradients and denote 
            characteristics of edges. For the Harris Corner Detector, we use  Gx and Gy to construct the Harris matrix for each pixel in the image. 
            The Harris matrix encapsulates the direction and magnitude of the largest and smallest intensity changes around each pixel and is defined 
            by the matrix below:
          </p>
          <center>
            <img src="./images/harris_matrix.png">
            <p><i>Figure: </i></p>
          </center>
          <p>
            The matrix is then used to calculate the response score that evaluates the likeliness of a pixel being a corner in the image. We calculated 
            the Harris matrix in the next part.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Compute the Harris corner R score for each pixel over a local neighborhood</b>

            corners = zeros(m, 2);<br>
            rVals = zeros(m, 1);<br><br>
          </code>
          <p>
            Upon calculating  Gx and Gy , we computed the products of those gradients, summed those values over local NxN neighborhoods, and then generated 
            the Harris matrix used to calculate the R score. After, we iterated through every pixel in the image from left to right, top to bottom and, 
            using the Harris matrix, applied the response function to every pixel. The response function for the R score is R = det(M)-k(trace(M))2, which 
            was covered in class and given to us in the instructions. Because we successfully calculated Gx and Gy earlier, the Harris Corner Detector can 
            effectively identify regions with significant variation in intensity in multiple directions, which indicate corners.

          </code>
          <p>
            At this point, we have calculated the R score for each pixel within the image. The last step would be applying a threshold to retrieve the “best” 
            corner features in the image. However, whenever a strong R response occurs, there are also several strong responses nearby. In other words, there 
            are multiple detections of the same corner in the image.
          </p>
          <p>
            To mitigate the problem, we had to filter out those detections to get a sparse set of corners. We followed the instructions provided and extracted 
            the corners in decreasing order of R values. We started the pixel with the maximum R value, then set all pixels within some distance `d` of the pixel 
            to a small value, effectively suppressing those neighboring pixels. We repeat the process with the next highest R value. While there are other 
            approaches to suppression, we thought the suggestions provided in the PDF were the easiest to implement. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Output all corner features into an ASCII file</b>
          <code>
            <br>% write values to output file<br>
            writematrix(m, "output.dat");<br>
            writematrix([rVals, corners], "output.dat", "WriteMode","append");<br><br>
          </code>
          <p>
            Finally, we wrote all the corners discovered by the Harris Corner Detector into an ASCII file. Each row in the file represents a corner detected in the 
            image. The first column indicates the R score of the corner. The second column specifies the column location of the corner in the image. Similarly, 
            the third column shows the row location of the corner within the image.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To visualize the algorithmic approach, we also created a flowchart to show the flow of control and subroutine structure of the code.
